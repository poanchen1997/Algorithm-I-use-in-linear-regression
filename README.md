# Algorithm I use in linear regression

This folder contains the example I learn from the course,  and some of them are from my homework, 
and the others are from the lecture. I thought this is useful, especially cross validation and 
non-parametric bootstrap. The example here are just the basic use of them, most of the time we combine
some of them to get a formal report.
